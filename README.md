# What are Design Patterns?

## what it is
* Design patterns are optimized, reusable solutions to the programming problems that we encounter every day.
* It is a template that has to be implemented in the correct situation.

## what it is not
* A design pattern is not a class or a library that we can simply plug into our system

## There are three basic kinds of design patterns

* structural
* creational
* behavioral

**Structural** patterns generally deal with relationships between entities, making it easier for these entities to work together.

**Creational** patterns provide instantiation mechanisms, making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the situation.

**Behavioral** patterns are used in communications between entities and make it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.
